### SWAPI Assignment ###

The school assignment for a webpage using SWAPI. Contains a total of five pages, one home page and four thematic pages where the API will be implemented.

The API implemented will show the sites theme, the information will be no less than 6 records, and each record will display no less than 5 properties, and a picture that displays the entity or object.

All of the pages have navigational links between the five pages. 
A little bit of Star Wars themed design for the general layout of the pages, to give it some flare!
